Welcome!  Despite the name of this file, a surprising
number of people may not remember to read it :-)

Simple instructions for compiling and running ministatic:

In the ministatic directory:

0) jacc syntax/Mini.jacc
   (builds syntax/MainParser.java and syntax/MiniTokens.java)

1) javac Compiler.java ast/*.java
   (builds Compiler.java and all the minitour Test*.java
   programs in the ast folder)

2) java Compiler test
   (runs the ministatic program---called Compiler for
   compatibility with the minitour---on the code in
   test.mini).

If you don't have jacc installed and you are using the
Linuxlab, you are welcome to use "~mpj/jacc" instead.

If you need a refresher on minitour grammar, at least
for the features that are not added as part of this
assignment, then check out the original minitour
documentation, but be aware that this code does include
a few changes ... as an alternative resource, you might
also want to review the "official" grammar as it is
presented in syntax/Mini.jacc.
